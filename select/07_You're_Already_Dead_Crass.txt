ATTENTION
Fuck American power. Fuck Russian power. Fuck British power
Fuck all power
ATTENTION
These ignorant shits arm themselves
For annihilation and call it world peace
Bollocks

Pacified. Classified
Keep in line. You're doing fine
Lost your voice? There ain't no choice
Play the game. Silent and tame
Be the passive observer, sit back and look
At the world they destroyed and the peace that they took
Ask no questions, hear no lies
And you'll be living in the comfort of a fool's paradise

You're already dead, you're already dead
You're already dead, you're already dead

If you're the passive observer, here's a message for you
You're already dead, You're already dead
Afraid to do what you know you should do
You're already dead, You're already dead
The world's at the edge of nuclear destruction
But your too afraid to make the connection
You still believe the system's there for your protection
You're already dead, You're already dead

You're already dead, you're already dead
You're already dead, you're already dead

By letting it happen without a fight
You're already dead, You're already dead
With your endless debates about wrong and right
You're already dead, You're already dead
Nothing's going to change if you're not prepared to act
There's no point complaining after the fact
Content to be a number, branded X and neatly packed
You're already dead, You're already dead

You're already dead, You're already dead
You're already dead, You're already dead

Four hundred thousand people marched for CND
They're already dead, They're already dead
Unless they're willing to act on what they can see
They're already dead, They're already dead
If each and every one of us was prepared to fight for more
To stand against the system that creates the need for war
The elite would have to run like it's never run before
They're already dead, They're already dead

They're already dead, They're already dead
They're already dead, They're already dead

We don't need organising
Or politicians being patronising
We don't need their leadership
Trendy lefties being hip
Don't need their condescension
Or their back to root pretension
We've heard it all before
Politicians saying "No more war"
Pulling wool across our eyes
We don't need their dangerous lies
We won't accept capitulation
It's just manipulation
They want the smooth without the rough
But words and gestures aren't enough
We've got to learn to reject all leaders
And the passive shit they feed us

They're already dead, They're already dead
They're already dead, They're already dead

If you think moderation's going to pave the way to peace
You're already dead, You're already dead
What good is moderation 'gainst the army and police?
You're already dead, You're already dead
We're not promoting mindless violence, keep that for the fools
We're simply saying be prepared to break their laws and rules
Let them know the bigger they come, the harder they will fall
They're already dead, They're already dead

They're already dead, They're already dead
They're already dead, They're already dead

If they're going to play it dirty, so are we
They're already dead, They're already dead
They can keep their lies about the land of the free
They're already dead, They're already dead
We've allowed them too often to use their iron fist
But there's one little detail they appear to have missed
You don't have to be PASSIVE just because you're a PACIFIST
They're already dead, They're already dead

They're already dead, They're already dead
They're already dead, They're already dead

They'll try to sell their system
Like it's some kind od age-old wisdom
But we've been had like that before
It's just the rich exploiting the poor
Well here's an honest confession
We think it's time they learnt a lesson
They've tried to hold the people down
But we've simply gone underground
Moving in the darkness looking for the light
Looking for a future and ready to fight
Looking for the freedom that's been denied
Fast to attack and fast to hide
In a world where the people can't make it
They've simply got to learn to break it
And if the wealthy aren't prepared to shake it
O.K., we'll simply have to take it

You're already dead, You're already dead
You're already dead, You're already dead
You're already dead, You're already dead
You're already dead, You're already dead
